# snf_explore

In this code I explore functionality of the `SNFtool` R package. (`R/snf_exploration.Rmd`). 

I modified the source code for the `SNFtool::SNF()` function into a function called `SNF_margie()` which outputs the iteration steps so that we can visualize what happens during the iteration step as the algorithm moves towards convergence.
